Day 1: Set up Python, Git, VSCode. Started to relearn Git and transfered all my repos back to github. Now that I am able to manage my files, this will be a lot easier. This is a pretty good stop point for day 1. 
Day 2: Fairly sleep deprived, not as productive of a day. Set up arch machine with python and code to have matching environments. Note still need to set up keys on the laptop. Did some reading on Python, next day will be making some scripts!
Day 3: Longer day. Using Learnxinyminutes in github, I am going to follow their instructions for a speed course in python. As I was not too shabby with C, this will help me learn the tools of the language before digging into how the language really works. I'll start with Chapter 1 and move right along to advanced. I may also throw in some other code in experimenting and researching other sources when questions arise. 
Chapter 1 is now complete. I'm suprised at the looseness compared to C. Tomorrow is iffy, but Saturday i'll be right back at it.
