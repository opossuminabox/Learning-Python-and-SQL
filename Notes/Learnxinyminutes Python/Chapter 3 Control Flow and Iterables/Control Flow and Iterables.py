# This is one of the most un-c-like things i'm going to see in Python. 
# Errors like everything else are objects
# Throwing an error is like triggering a software interrupt
# Python automatically jumps to the correct handler. 

''' Advanced Notes:
try:
    code that might fail
except ERROR HERE:
    runs ONLY if something failed
else:
    runs ONLY if nothing failed
finally:
    ALWAYS runs no matter what

    
Can also remember as

try:        # "Attempt this..."
except:     # "...if something fails, go here."
else:       # "...otherwise, if everything works, go here." (Optional)
finally:    # "...and ALWAYS finish with this."

Also note that 
pass
in python is like a placeholder. It can be used where python expects something.
It can also be used as a "I don't really care about this error" insert like below
'''

try:
    # Use raise to force an error to come up. It also has other uses. It forces something to happen RIGHT NOW.
    raise IndexError("this is an index error")
except IndexError as e:     # Stores the error as variable e, very helpful.
    pass                    # Not a great habit to pass on errors unless you TRUELY know you can. Can mask bigger issues. Avoid unless completely necessary.
except (TypeError, NameError):
    print("There is a Type Error or a Name Error")
else:
    print("Good to go!")    # Runs only if no issues
finally:
    print("We can clean up resources here")     # Runs regardless



''' Advanced Notes:
with is not error handling, it's resource management. 
with automatically does a cleanup routine for you.
